Byte pair encoding, dual tile encoding, or digram coding is a static
dictionary compression method first disclosed to the public by Philip
Gage in 1994.  Each symbol in the compressed data represents a
sequence of two symbols, which may be compressed symbols or literals.
Its size performance is comparable to LZW but without needing RAM
for a dynamic dictionary.
http://www.drdobbs.com/a-new-algorithm-for-data-compression/184402829

The decompression is as follows:

for each symbol in the input:
    push the symbol on the stack
    while the stack is not empty:
        pop a symbol from the stack
        if the symbol is literal:
            emit the symbol
        else:
            push the second child
            push the first child

I'm not guaranteeing that it's optimal, but here's a greedy
compressor:

scan for frequencies of all symbol pairs
while a pair has high enough frequency:
    allocate a new symbol
    replace the old pair with the new symbol
    decrease count of replaced pairs
    increase count of newly created pairs

This is O(k*n) because of the replacements.

lipsum = """"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
